# Largest

You are tasked with writing a program that will two lines from the
user and store them in appropriate variables.

You will need to convert the values to a more appropriate data type
that you can then compare against each other. You want to find out
what value is larger, if A is > B or if B is > A or if A == B.

Example 1:

```
Enter value for A: 10
Enter value for B: 20

20 is the largest
```

Example 2:

```
Enter value for A: 35
Enter value for B: 21

35 is the largest
```

Example 1:

```
Enter value for A: 15
Enter value for B: 15

15 is the largest but the other value was the same
```

## How to Test

You can test your program by running `dotnet test` against a suite
of test cases.
