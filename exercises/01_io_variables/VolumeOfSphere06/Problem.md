# Volume Of A Sphere

Write a program that will calculate the volume of a sphere.
The program must allow the user to input the radius of the sphere.

Formula: V = (4/3) * pi * r^3

Example:

```
What is the radius of the sphere: 2
Volume is: 33.51032
```

Make sure your output is to 5 decimal places.

## How to test

You can test your solution against a suite of test cases with
`dotnet test`.
