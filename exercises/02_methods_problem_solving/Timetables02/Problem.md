# Timetables

You are to construct a program that will accept a command line argument
that will then compute the timestable of that number. The argument will
be provided as a numeric value as a string data type. You will need
to convert the string to an integer.


Example:
```
./timestable 6
6
12
18
24
30
36
42
48
54
60
66
72
```


## How to test

You can test your program using `dotnet test` against a set
of test cases provided.
