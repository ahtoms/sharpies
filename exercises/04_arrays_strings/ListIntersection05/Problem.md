# List Intersection

You are tasked with implementing a static method that will
compute a new List that contains elements that two other lists have in common.

You will need to implement the method:

```
public static List<int> Intersection(List<int> listA, List<int> listB)
```

`listA` and `listB` may have elements in common. Any common elements
would be included in a new list, any duplicate elements would not be
included in the final list.

If there are no common elements, the new list would be empty.


## How to test

You are able to test your implementation against a suite of test
cases by running `dotnet test`.
