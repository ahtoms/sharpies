# Enrollment

You are tasked with writing two classes:

* Subject
* Student

Each class will represent and have their own fields and methods associated. What makes
this problem interesting is that there will be usage of direct references between
the two types.

In this case, we will have Students that are associated with a Subject and Subjects which
are associated with students.
